### I'll be your guide, the Fat Dev Ninja.
Let me introduce myself, I'm Jeff, a senior developer with almost a decade of experience working with big brands like Viacom, IBM, and Pinnacle Vodka. I have seen a lot of changes and transformations over the years, as well I have worked with many languages and technology stacks both front and back end. After all this, however, I'm ready for a change, and that change is into DevOps.

#### What is DevOps? 
Well, that's a complicated and loaded question. Some say it's just a buzzword for System Administrators who want to code or developers who want root access on the production server. Some say it is a culture, philosophy, and movement, not something that can be given as a title, but something that has to be spread across an entire organisation. In plain English (and in my opinion), DevOps is a little of all these things. It is a culture that has to be spread across the company, a culture of developers and operations staff working closely together, as well it represents developers having more access, and with that knowledge (and responsibility) to the deployment and hosting of code, as well Ops staff being more involved in the code in the development process. And though for DevOps to work within an organisation, you don't need DevOps engineers, it definitely helps to have somebody with that title to help drive the change and help everyone in the transition.

#### Why write this?
My hope for this blog is to describe my thoughts, feelings, and ideas on DevOps, as I begin to transition from the senior developer at an agency with almost 200 employees to being their first DevOps engineer.
